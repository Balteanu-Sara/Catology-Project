Once upon a time, in a small village by the river, there lived a kind farmer named John. He worked hard every day, planting crops and taking care of his animals. The villagers admired him because he always helped anyone in need. One day, a terrible storm swept through the village, destroying many homes and fields. Despite the challenges, John encouraged everyone to rebuild together. His kindness and determination brought hope to the entire community, and soon the village became even stronger than before.
